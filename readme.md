## Tasks:

| Number | Requirement                                      | Marks | Achieved? |
|:------:|:------------------------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------:|
| G1     | Evidense of use of GitLab by group showing incremental development through regular commits and commit messages | REQ |   X   |
| G2     | Use of D3 hierarchical display to illustrate agglomerative clustering of topicto-topic similarity | REQ |   X   |
| R1     | Use of three different D3 layouts in a single dashboard | 6 |   X   |
| R2     | Use of automatic scaling of all axes in a single layout during data update. | 2 |   X   |
| R3     | Use of datum highlighting in which hovering over a datum provides additional information via a tooltip | 2 |   X   |
| R4     | Use of D3 transitions to highlight new (entering) data | 2 |   X   |
| R5     | Use of D3 transitions to highlight updating data  | 2 |   X   |
| R6     | Use of D3 transitions to highlight exiting data | 3 |   X   |
| R7     | Use of cross-layout brushing in which moussing over a data point in one chart highlights associated data in another chart | 2 |   X   |
| R8     | Use of cross-layout brushing in which moussing over one data point in one chart highlights multiple associated data points in another chart. Note: you must use a different combination of layouts than the ones provided in lab examples. | 3 |   X   |
| R9     | Significant use of data (> 100 data items) not provided by the course | 2 |   X   |
| R10    | Use of a scatter plot, a stacked barchart or, a linechart | 4 |   X   |
| R11    | Use of bidirectional interaction between three charts | 3 |    X   |
| R12    | Use of automatic scaling of all axes of a further two layouts during data update. | 2 |   X   |
| R13    | Use D3 hierarchical layout e.g. cluster, pack, partition, treemap, sunburst, or bundle, but a not tree layout | 2 |   X   |
| R14    | Use of selective reveal in a hierarchical layout display (e.g. revealing/concealing lower nodes in a dendrogram) | 2 |   X   |
| R15    | Faceted selection interaction between two layouts (in which mouseover or click in one layout results in data being filtered in a second  layout). Note: you must use a different combination of layouts than the ones provided in lab examples. | 2 |   X   |
| R16    | Use of a map layout that has interaction with another layout | 2 |    X   |
| R17    | Use of scalar data on a map (e.g. circles of different sizes to indicate the percentage of 4* outputs) | 3 |   X   |
| R18    | Use of cross-layout brushing in which dragging a rectangle over several data points in one chart highlights multiple associated data points in another chart | 2 |   X   |
| R19    | Use of the correlation between university/UOA star ratings and other data | 2 |   X   |
| R20    | Use of a custom (student written) shape generator | 3 |   X   |
| R21    | Use of a custom (student written) layout generator) | 2 |    X   |
| R22    | Use of a clustering analysis, other than than provided in the assignment dataset | 2 |    X   |
